# Workshop Overview
This workshop focuses on building stronger collaboration between designers and developers. We'll explore common challenges in the design-to-development process and provide practical strategies to overcome them. Through real-world examples and interactive exercises, participants will learn how to create more development-friendly designs and establish effective communication channels.

## What You'll Learn
- Design handoff best practices and documentation
- Understanding technical constraints and limitations
- Effective communication strategies with development teams
- Common developer pain points and how to address them
- Tools and processes for seamless collaboration
- Version control and design system management
- Handling feedback and iterations efficiently

## Prerequisites
