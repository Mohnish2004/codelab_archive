# Workshop Overview
In this unique role-reversal workshop, developers will take on design challenges to gain deeper insights into the design process. Through hands-on exercises and guided activities, participants will develop empathy for design work while learning fundamental design principles that can enhance their development practices.

## The Design Challenge: Raccoon Housing Finder
For this workshop, participants will tackle an unconventional design prompt: creating a mobile app that helps raccoons find secure housing in urban environments! This whimsical challenge comes with real user research, including:

### User Personas
- Rex: A suburban father of 3 struggling with locked trash cans
- Roxy: A country girl seeking better insulation
- Mabel: A new mother concerned about noise and bright lights
- Bandit: A frequent mover dealing with housing instability

### Key Pain Points
- Limited access to secure shelter options
- Safety concerns during travel and at potential locations
- Housing quality issues (size, insulation, location)
- Frequent displacement due to human intervention
- Noise and light pollution in urban areas

This unique prompt encourages creative problem-solving while removing the pressure of industry expectations, allowing participants to focus on core design principles and user-centered thinking.
